# Google Doodle 2
My Google Doodle is going to be centered around my joy of Subarus and a sort of nod to Subarus rally years (1995-1997). I will be using my brothers car as a base for my SVG that I will have drift across the screen billowing dust and dirt behind it. The car will enter stage left and exit stage right. The car will then re-enter stage right only the rear of the car will be facing the screen (as if it had spun around off screen). The car will then come to a stop off center and the brake lights will light up.
